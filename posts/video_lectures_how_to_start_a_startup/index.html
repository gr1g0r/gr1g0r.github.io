<p>This video&rsquo;s first speaker is the president of <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> Sam Altman. One of the biggest investment in
IT are that Y Combinator had is its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News website</a>. As a daily user of the Hacker News it became
more interesting for me what this guy will talk about.</p>

<p>Well, I have to say that the talk was quite interesting and informative. He
mainly talked about the four areas that you have to excel at to be able to start
a successful startup.</p>

<ol>
<li>Idea</li>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Team</li>
<li>Execution</li>
</ol>

<p>So let&rsquo;s start with the first one</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>

<p>According to Sam, the idea is one of the most important, as even if the greatest
executioners work on a terrible idea, most probably it will fail. So you have to
have an idea, that you believe is good enough and matters enough to work on it
in upcoming 10 years or more. If the idea will become not actual after a short
time, then it doesn&rsquo;t worth your time.</p>

<p>One of the main aspects you need to concentrate on while choosing the idea is
the market. You have to choose a market that grows rapidly. Small but rapidly
growing market is far better than the big and slowly growing one.</p>

<p>So choose your idea carefully, develop it around some mission that matters for
you and the team and don&rsquo;t forget about the market.</p>

<h2 id="the-product">The Product</h2>

<p>Often you can have a great idea but fail to crate a good product. To form a
successful company you need to be able to turn the great idea into a great
product. For that you have to keep customers in mind and create something that
they will love to use.</p>

<p>In fact, it is better to create something that small number of users will love,
or something that a huge number of users will like. Remember that it is easier
to expand over a great product.</p>

<p>An important part of creating a great product is paying attention to the
feedback. It is important to ask users for feedback and make decision based on
that feedback. After all, the users are the ones who will use your product or pay for it.</p>

<h2 id="but-why-to-start-a-startup">But Why to start a startup?</h2>

<p>Well, about the other the team and the execution Sam will speak during another
lecture. Until that, Dustin Moskovitzi, one of the co-founders of Facebook,
talks about why you should start a startup.</p>

<p>At first Dustin points out that starting a start is not as glamorous as it may
seem at the first glance. Starting a startup has an ugly side as well, which is
sitting in front of same desk for hours, trying to solve a difficult problem or
answer to customers.</p>

<p>Also, if you think that you will feel like boss in your company, according to
Dustin this is not the case. More probably everyone else will feel as boss.
You will not have any free time, will have to work <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>, always be on call.</p>

<p>If you have a great idea and an equally good product, most probably you will
have good financial reward and thus have more impact on the world around you.</p>

<p>So, if you have a great idea, a passion towards that idea and feel like you are
the one that has to do it, then you just can&rsquo;t not do it. In that case the best
thing is going for it and doing your best to succeed.</p>

<h2 id="some-discussion">Some discussion</h2>

<p>In my opinion, you have to start a startup, if you believe that somehow it will
change the world. I disagree with Sam that if there isn&rsquo;t market for the product
yet, creating one is a bad idea. There are many cases in history, that people
didn&rsquo;t know that the needed something, and after the inventors brought the
product to the market, people realised how much they needed it. In my opinion,
if you believe that you can change the world, the remaining doesn&rsquo;t matter, just
go for it.</p>

<p>Do you have your opinions about this topic? Let&rsquo;s discuss them in comments.</p>
