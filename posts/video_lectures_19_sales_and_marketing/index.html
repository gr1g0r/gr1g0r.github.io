<p>Good evening everybody! I am going to review the 19th lecture about starting a
startup. This video lecture&rsquo;s speaker is Tyler Bosmeny, who is the founder of
Clever.</p>

<p>According to Tyler sales isn&rsquo;t that difficult for the founder. In fact all he
has to is to talk to users. That&rsquo;s it! Being the founder gives you advantage
that you have the passion towards what you are building and you know the
industry and the problem you are solving with your product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What I&rsquo;ve learned is that when it comes to &ldquo;hiring the sales people,&rdquo; as a founder, the reality is that it&rsquo;s you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Tyler there are three ways to attract people to use your product.
The first one is your personal network. The second one is conferences, and the
last one is cold mails.</p>

<p>There is a common mistake that according to Tyler most founders do. That is when
they talk to companies, the company says for example &ldquo;I like your product, but
it lacks this feature which I need&rdquo;. Most founders try to add that feature
quickly, thinking that that way the company will actually buy the product, but
in most of cases that is not working that way.</p>

<p>So what you should do in that cases? According to Tyler you can suggest to sign
the agreement, after which you will implement the needed feature, or you can say
&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s wait and see if other customers have need that feature or not. If
they do, I will add the feature and reach back to you&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Another advice from Tyler is to avoid free-trials. In startup you need revenue,
validation, users and commitment. None of those things you can get by offering
free trials. If you are requested to give a free trial of your product what you
can do is simply say</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t do free trials. We do annual agreements and what we&rsquo;ll do is for the
first 30 or 60 days, if for any reason you&rsquo;re not happy, you can opt out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These were my takeouts from this lecture. If you have other ideas or lied other
points in the lecture let&rsquo;s discuss them in the comment section.</p>
