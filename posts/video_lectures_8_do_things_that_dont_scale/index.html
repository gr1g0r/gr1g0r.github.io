<p>Hello everyone! Today&rsquo;s video lecture&rsquo;s speaker is <strong>Stanley Tang</strong>, who is the
founder of <strong>DoorDash</strong>.</p>

<p>Well, at first Stanley was telling about how everything started in DoorDash and
how they tested whether delivery system was a good idea. What they did, is
pretty simple! They just launched a demo website in an hour and tested if they
would get orders.</p>

<p>The main message Stanley tried to give was that you don&rsquo;t need much to start a
startup. You need to launch it as fast as you can, and at first you shouldn&rsquo;t
scale. Scale only where there is the demand for it.</p>

<p>The next speaker is <strong>Walker Williams</strong> who is the founder and CEO of
<strong>Teespring</strong>. He is speaking about <em>&ldquo;Three places to leverage your advantage.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h2 id="finding-your-first-users">Finding your first users</h2>

<p>According to Walker <strong>there&rsquo;s no silver bullet for user acquisition!</strong> The
majorities of companies gained their first users very very hard. The founder of
company has the responsibility to do whatever it takes to get the first users.
After that, when users add up, everything will get a bit easier.</p>

<h2 id="turning-users-into-champions">Turning users into champions</h2>

<p>According to Walker a champion is the user who talks about your product or
recommends it to others. The best way to turn your users into champions is to
<strong>talk to them.</strong> But how we need to talk with them? Well, Walker recommends
these three ways to talk with your customers.</p>

<ol>
<li>Run customer service as long as possible</li>
<li>Proactive reach out to current and churned customers</li>
<li>Social media</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="finding-product-market-fit">Finding product/market fit</h2>

<p>An important point here is that the product you launch at first, <strong>will not end
up being the product that you will scale up with.</strong> In a startup you may have
dirty and not right code as the most important thing is that it has to work, and
it has to work as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The 3rd speaker is <strong>Justin Kan</strong>, who appears to be the founder of
<strong>Justin.tv</strong>, and, the more famous one <strong>Twitch</strong>. In this video he is speakig
about PR.</p>

<p>Well, to be honest this part of the video was the most interesting for me. I
always wanted to know how the new and not famous products appear in websites
like theVerge or HackerNews.</p>

<p>As it appears, it doesn&rsquo;t happen magically. At first you need to have a goal,
which you will achieve by appearing in media. For example in case of Twitch, the
goal was to reach to the customers in Gaming Industry.</p>

<p>But for appearing in press, you need to have a story. Stories can be different,
it is important to have a story which will help you achieve the goal you set up
earlier. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be original, it need to be interesting.</p>

<p>Do you have your opinions about this topic? Let&rsquo;s discuss them in comments.</p>
