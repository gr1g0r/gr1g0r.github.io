<p>Hey everyone! In this post I am reviewing 4th lecture about how to start a
startup. So, this time the lecturer is Adora Cheung and she speaks about
Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing.</p>

<p>This time I am going to do things a bit different. Instead of reviewing the
video lecture, I am going to write all the things I find interesting.</p>

<p>I liked the part about the things people do wrong when starting a startup. All
that about keeping everything a secret, sudden revealing, etc&hellip; I am glad that
she spoke about this, as I myself was going to do this things. I planned to keep
my startup a secret until it is ready and then do a big publishing day, etc. Now
I see why that was a terrible idea. What I plan to do now is to get contact with
some people, explain them the product, give them the alpha or beta version and
ask for help for testing it.</p>

<p>I also liked the part about how to find users. Make your mom and friends to use
your product, if you cannot convince them to use, how can you ever hope to
convince millions of strangers.</p>

<p>One of the main important parts in this video is
Build fast and ship the product whenever it is ready. If you keep developing it
by thinking that it yet need some more features, someone may steal it, do it
faster and steal the market. So don&rsquo;t hesitate and lunch it already.</p>

<p>A good way to get users is referral programs. So your users will bring more and
more users and your startup will grow exponentially. Although I think that this
will not work with my idea, I still like this idea.</p>

<p>These were just my takeaways from the video, I recommend it to watch as there
are many things which I skipped in my post but you may find interesting.
Do you have your opinions about this topic? Let&rsquo;s discuss them in comments.</p>
