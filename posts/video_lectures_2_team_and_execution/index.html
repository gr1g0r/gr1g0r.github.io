<p>Hey everyone! In this post I am going to review the second lecture of the
president of the <a href="ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> Sam Altman regarding to starting startups. If you remember in the previous <a href="https://gr1g0r.github.io/posts/video_lectures_how_to_start_a_startup/">video</a> Sam
talked about the importance of the idea and the product in starting a startup.
In this lecture he speaks about the next two aspects that you have to keep in
mind while starting a startup. Those are <strong>Team</strong>, and <strong>Execution</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>

<p>According to Sam, it is very important to pay attention to whom you are inviting
to your team. You shouldn&rsquo;t just meet people and invite them to your team. You
need to know your co-founders for some time, ideally for years. Usually
successful startups have two or three co-founders.</p>

<p>The second advice of Sam is &ldquo;Try not to hire&rdquo;. Stay as small as possible. Hire
people only when there is huge need. That&rsquo;s because in case you choose wrong
employee, the damage to your company will be too big.</p>

<p>If finally you feel the urge of hiring, get the best people. When you&rsquo;re in
&ldquo;hiring mode&rdquo;, you should spend around 25% of your time to find an ideal
employee for your company. While hiring an employee for your company, you shall
pay attention to 3 things.</p>

<ol>
<li>Are they smart?</li>
<li>Do they get things done?</li>
<li>Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?</li>
</ol>

<p>Well, let&rsquo;s assume you&rsquo;ve hired the best people, the next task is retaining
them. According to Sam it is a very hard task and takes some time gaining skills
for that.</p>

<p>Finally, you have to fire fast. Fire the people who don&rsquo;t work, cause problems
or make the team unhappy.</p>

<h2 id="execution">Execution</h2>

<p>According to Sam, Execution maybe is not the most fun part, but is critical. The
main jobs of CEO are</p>

<ol>
<li>Setting the vision</li>
<li>Raising money</li>
<li>Evangelizing</li>
<li>Hiring and managing</li>
<li>Making sure the company executes</li>
</ol>

<p>For execution you have to decide whether a specific task can be done, and if
yes, then find means to get it done. You need to set overarching goals, get them
done and move forward setting more goals. Your company needs to stay focused,
and the best way of keeping them is communication. Communication helps to make
sure the everyone is working towards the same goal.</p>

<p>Intensity is another important part is of execution. You have to dedicate much
time outwork you competitors. If you look at the successful startups, they did
everything to even slightly outrun their competitors.</p>

<p>If you have some opinions about the video or the review, let&rsquo;s discuss them in
the comments section.</p>
