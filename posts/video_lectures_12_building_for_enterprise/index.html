<p>Hello everyone, Today I am going to review another video about how to start a
startup. Today the guest lecturer is Aaron Levie who is the CEO and co-founder
of the Box, and he is going to speak about building enterprise software.</p>

<p>Box is a cloud content management and file sharing service for businesses. In
the lecture Aaron talks about the history of the Box. According to him, at first
they didn&rsquo;t plan to create enterprise software, they just noticed that file
sharing is was a really hard procedure and tried to fix that by creating the
Box.</p>

<p>According to Aaron, while building the Box, it came time when their product had
far more features than an average user needs, and not enough features for
enterprise companies. And that is when they had to decide which path to go.
After much thinking they decided to give it a shot and try to sell their product
to enterprise, even when everyone around told them that they will fail.</p>

<p>Aaron thinks that now is the perfect time for building for enterprise, since now
the technology is moving to cloud, it is easier to deliver and manage the
software. Another important factor is that today computing becomes cheaper.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As soon as the computing becomes cheaper, its easier to adopt new solutions.
Which means, their barrier for showing you in the barrier is a lot lower
which is great for startups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today the world is changing rapidly, hence the enterprises try to adapt to the
new need of the customers. For that they are going through a lot of changes too
and that is the best time for startups to come in and suggest their solutions to
the enterprises.</p>

<p>In enterprise it is better to start small and create a product that will slip
in the gaps of other existing products but will expand to a more important
product.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Listen to your customers but don&rsquo;t always build exactly what they are
telling you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means is that you need to listen to all of their requests and
problems, and at the end give the simplified solution.</p>

<p>These were the most interesting ideas for me found in the video. If you have other interesting ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to write a comment.</p>
