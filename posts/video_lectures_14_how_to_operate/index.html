<p>Hello everyone, Today I am going to review another video about how to start a
startup. Today the guest lecturer is Aaron Levie who is going to talk about how
to operate.</p>

<p>According to Aaron, forging a company is much harder than forging a product,
since people are irrational. Building an organization is essentially similar to taking all the irrational individuals you know placing them in one building, and after that living with them twelve hours per day. Building a company is very similar to building an engine and it takes lots of effort from people. At the end you want to get a perfect machine, about which nobody has to worry about every hour. As Warren Buffett says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Build a company that idiots could run because eventually they will.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When starting to build the company everything will feel like a mess, otherwise
you are not innovating much. Everyday you will encounter a new problem, which
actually will go away, and you don&rsquo;t need to worry about them constantly. But
there are some problems, that if not dealt with properly can become fatal.</p>

<p>A very important metaphor in you company is the editor. The first thing that he
does is to take out the red pen and eliminate, simplify and omit things. And you
have that responsibility as well, to simplify everything for the other people of
your team.</p>

<p>Another part from the lecture that I liked is about making decisions, whether
you should delegate or do it yourself. In most cases, when the decision will not
have huge impact on your company an d you are not sure on your decision you need
to delegate. If, on the other side, the consequences will be huge, you need to
do it yourself.</p>

<p>You need to edit your team constantly. One of the ways to do it is to expand the
scope of responsibilities of the employee, until he breaks. And whenever he
breaks, that is the role he should stay in.</p>

<p>Another important idea is that you have to always pay attention to details. If
you do all the details right, then you don&rsquo;t need to worry about having a
billion dollar revenue or having billion users.</p>

<p>These were the most interesting ideas for me found in the video. If you have other interesting ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to write a comment.</p>
