<p>There&rsquo;s a lot that goes behind the scenes in running a startup. Getting the legal, finance (equity allocation, vesting), accounting, and other overhead right will save you a lot of pain in the long run. Kirsty Nathoo, CFO at Y Combinator, and Carolynn Levy, General Counsel at Y Combinator, cover these very important topics in this lecture.</p>

<p><em>From youtube desciption</em></p>

<p>Good afternoon! As you probably guessed I am going to review another video
lecture about how to start a startup. This time the guest lecturers are Kirsty
Nathoo and Carolynn Levy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Founders don&rsquo;t need to know the mechanics of starting a startup
<em>- Paul Graham -</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accounting to Carolynn, Graham meant that founders don&rsquo;t need to know everything
in detail, and they are not going to go into much details in this lecture.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s do here what they did in this lecture and not go into much details in this
review. So I am going to just point out my tookouts from this lecture.</p>

<h3 id="where-to-form">Where to form?</h3>

<p>Delaware - it is in the business of forming corporations and it is easy to start
there. Another good point s that investors are very comfortable in investing in
Delaware corporations.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-set-up">How to set up?</h3>

<p>Just fax two pieces of paper to Delaware and say that you want to found a
corporations. That&rsquo;s all you need to set the shell of your company. Then come
documents and documents and documents, you need to choose CEO, President, etc.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-the-equity">What about the equity?</h3>

<p>If the stock of your company is high, then it&rsquo;s time to think about how will you
divide the equity. For that, at first you need to speak with co-founders.</p>

<p>The execution is far more important than the idea. Hence, a co-founder doesn&rsquo;t
deserve more equity just because he was the one who came p with the idea.</p>

<p>In most of cases it is better to divide the stock equally between co-founders.</p>

<p>All founders must be 100% in the startup.</p>

<h3 id="vesting">Vesting?</h3>

<p>Vesting is when you get full ownership of the stock for some period of time.If a
person leaves before the vesting period ends, the company can get that shares
back.</p>

<p>In Silicon Valley the so called standard vesting period is four years with a one year cliff.</p>

<h3 id="raise-money-what-if-someone-agrees-to-invest">Raise money: What if someone agrees to invest?</h3>

<p>Pay attention on how much of your equity you are giving to investors. Keep in
mind that in future there may be better investors, and giving 40% of the company
just at the beginning is not wise.</p>

<h3 id="i-raised-the-money-then-what">I raised the money. Then what?</h3>

<p>This is when you start to incurring business expenses: costs to carry out your
business. That includes the salary of the employees, office rent, hosting costs,
etc.</p>

<h3 id="you-need-to-pay">You need to pay</h3>

<p>All the employees, as well as founder must be paid, at least the minimum wage.
And no, just the equity is not enough.</p>

<p>This was for this post. Don&rsquo;t forget to comment your ideas!</p>
