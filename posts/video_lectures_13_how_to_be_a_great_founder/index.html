<p>Hello everyone, today I am going to review another lecture about how to start a
startup. This time the guest lecturer is Reid Hoffman, who appears to be the
co-founder and current Executive chairman of the Linkedin. In this lecture he is
telling about how to be a great founder.</p>

<p>Reid started his lecture by stating that our picture about great founders is
wrong, and that great founders do not have some kind of superpowers. Instead,
they spend the majority of their time in solving different problems.</p>

<p>Though the great founder is not the one who has superpower, but there are some
skills which can help to become a better founder.</p>

<p>According to Reid, one of the most important things is the <strong>team</strong>. Reid states
that for a starting company, the best team is consisted of two or three people
with different skills, who can complete each other.</p>

<p>Another important thing is the location. It is crucial to choose the right
location for your startup. In fact many of the founders move to Silicon Valley
without considering whether it is good location for their company. And according
to Reid, even though Silicon Valley has a lot of advantages, for many companies
it is not the right place.</p>

<p>Another question that some founders have is should they be contrarian. Reid
thinks that being a contrarian is good, as long as you are a contrarian in the
right way. If you think that you are smarter than anyone else, then you are the
wrong type of contrarian. Instead you can ask yourself what do you know that
others don&rsquo;t. That thing can be your key to success.</p>

<p>Reid states that you should both do work and also delegate. And in some cases
you need to do both in 100%. You also need to be both flexible and persistent,
confident and cautious, focus internally and externally, work by vision and by
data, take risks and try to minimize risks, focus on the long term and on the
short term at the same time.</p>

<p>These were the most interesting ideas for me found in the video. If you have other interesting ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to write a comment.</p>
