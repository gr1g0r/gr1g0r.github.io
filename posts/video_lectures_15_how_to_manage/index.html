<p>Hello everyone, Today I am going to review another video about how to start a
startup. Today the guest lecturer is Ben Horowitz and he is going to speak about
how to manage.</p>

<p>Because of lack of time, he speaks only about one of the concepts of management,
since according to him, that is where the majority of CEOs screw up.</p>

<p>According to Ben, when making a critical decision, you have to understand how
it&rsquo;s going to be interpreted from every point of view. You have to be able to
see the decision that you re going to make through the eyes of whole company. In
other words, you need to take into account how each and every employee of the
company will feel about that decision (Ben brings wonderful examples to support
his ideas, for examples watch the video lecture). Making a decision about an
employee or a topic is not going to affect only that person or topic, but the
whole company. Hence, you need to be careful for your each and every decision.</p>

<p>A very hard thing is making sure that the. Though that employee stays. Ben
suggests two ways of doing that. The first way is to give your employees 10 yeas
to exercise their stock, and he will get that regardless of his social status.
The next way is to say them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look you are guaranteed to get your salary but for your stock to be meaningful, these are the things that have to happened. You have to have vested. Two, you have to stay until we get to an exit. Until the company makes it. You&rsquo;ve got other money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this means do not join us, if you are going to leave after a little time. If
you are joining us, than you stay with us until we succeed.</p>

<p>Then he brings example of how Toussaint did a successful revolution by looking
at the situation not only with his eyes, but with eyes of his soldiers and the
enemy.</p>

<p>These were the most interesting ideas for me found in the video. If you have
other interesting ideas, don&rsquo;t hesitate to write a comment.</p>
