<p>Hello everybody! Today I am going to write all the stuff I find useful in this
video lecture. Well, this time the speaker is Alex Schultz and he is speaking
about Growth.</p>

<h2 id="what-matters-most-for-growth">What matters most for growth</h2>

<p>According to Alex <strong>the single most important thing for growth is retention.</strong>
And for a good retention it is important to have a good product. Without a
good product it is almost impossible to get good retention.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-good-retention-look-like">What does good retention look like</h2>

<p>According to Alex it is not hard to distinguish good retention from bad one.
What you need to do is to see how many potential users are there for your
product and what part of them actually use your product. For each product good
retention rate may differ.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-attack-operating-for-growth">How do you attack operating for growth.</h2>

<p>Well, according to Alex if you are a startup you don&rsquo;t need to (shouldn&rsquo;t) have
a growth team. If you are startup, your whole company, including the CEO, has to
be the growth team.</p>

<p>Also, you have to set the &ldquo;north star&rdquo; of growth for your company, towards which
your employees shall work. If it is not clear for your employees, you will not
be able to control them, they will do whatever they want to, even if that wasn&rsquo;t
your initial goal.</p>

<p>For providing growth, you don&rsquo;t need to concentrate on people who are already
using your product. What you need to concentrate on are the new users. You not
only need to attract new users, but also shall be able to keep that users to use
your product.</p>

<h2 id="more-tactics">More tactics</h2>

<p><strong>1. virality</strong> - How many people can you hit at once, How many times can you
hit them and what are they going to convert at will give you fundamental idea of
how viral a product is.</p>

<p><strong>2. SEO</strong> - In search engine optimization (SEO) you need to focus on three
things: keyword research, links and right website structure (right headers, XML
sitemaps, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>3. Email</strong> - According to Alex email is dead for people under 25, as they are
not using email anymore. Email, SMS and push notifications all behave the same
way and have the same purpose. You need to be careful not to be marked as spam,
as getting out from there will be extremely difficult.</p>

<p>Do you have your opinions about this topic? Let&rsquo;s discuss them in comments.</p>
