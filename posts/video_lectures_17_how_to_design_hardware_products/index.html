<p>Hello everyone! In this post I am going to review yet another video lecture
about how to start a startup and today the guest lecturer is Hosain Rahman, who
is the Founder and CEO of Jewbone. In this lecture he is speaking about how to
design software products.</p>

<p>In his company they mostly develop IOT (Internet of Things) devices, hence work
a lot with hardware. According to Hosain, you they try to make such good
hardware, that users can keep on them <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub>. On the other hand, IOT creates a lot
of data, and they have to know what to do with it. They have to know how to
process it, push it and make it work for the user. At the start, doing all this
together was the hard part, since the engineers who are very good from hardware, are not
usually that good from software part and the contrary.</p>

<p>It is important to imagine what you are going to build, think about the vision
of the path that the world is going in, where it will be some tie later. It is
important to keep in the mind the brand and what it stands for. According to
Rahman, they build from inspiration, insight and creativity.</p>

<p>The next step is to actually think how you are going to build that vision. Is it
possible and if yes how will you bring it to life, and later how are you going
to sell it. After this, the next step is the development part, where you solve
problems, learn and gain feedback from user.</p>

<p>It is also equally important to pay attention to each and every detail. For
example, Rahman tells, that they searched a lot and found only one manufacturer
whose rubber had the quality and the colors that they wanted for their first
Jambox.</p>

<p>I likes this sentence from Rahman&rsquo;s talk, which I quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think of ourselves as a hardware team or a software team or a data company. We think of ourselves as an experiences company. It&rsquo;s not just about this physical device or that feature. It&rsquo;s about the system. It&rsquo;s about how the pieces come together.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, this lecture contains so much information, that to put all that in
this small review, I had to write everything word by word. So with this quote I
finish this review, but I strongly recommend to watch the whole video. If you
have questions or other opinions let&rsquo;s discuss them in the comment section.</p>
