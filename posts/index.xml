      <description>This video&amp;rsquo;s first speaker is the president of Y Combinator Sam Altman. One of the biggest investment in IT are that Y Combinator had is its Hacker News website. As a daily user of the Hacker News it became more interesting for me what this guy will talk about.
Well, I have to say that the talk was quite interesting and informative. He mainly talked about the four areas that you have to excel at to be able to start a successful startup.</description>
