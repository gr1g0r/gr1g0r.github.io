<p>Hello everybody, today I am going to review another video lectre about starting
a successful startup, and today&rsquo;s guest lecturer is Emmett Shear. Emmett is the
CEO of Twitch, which is the most popular platform among gamers (and not only)
for game streaming. In this lecture Emmett is going to speak about &ldquo;How to Run a User
Interview&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At first Emmett starts by telling about his first startups. The first startup
was the &ldquo;Kiko Calendar&rdquo;. Which was good, but didn&rsquo;t go too far. Since they
didn&rsquo;t know much about calendars, they used to ask about calendars to anybody who used
them. Which was not optimal and they never got to the talk to users part.</p>

<p>The second startup was the Justin.tv: A website for people to broadcast their
lives. Since the primary users of the website were themselves, they didn&rsquo;t do
the talk to users part this time as well. The only problem was that they didn&rsquo;t
know how to develop the product further. The idea that Emmett came up with was
in game industry: a platform where people could broadcast video games. And that
is how the Twitch was born.</p>

<p>According to Emmett, you don&rsquo;t need to ask the user questions about optimizing
user flow in the first interview, since that will distract the users, who mostly
think that they know what do they want.</p>

<p>Emmett states, that during the first period of Justin.tv gaming platform, the
users of the platform addressed several issues. While many people would go and
try to solve them, that&rsquo;s not what Emmett and his team did. According to him, if
the problems users tell about really exist and they still use them, than maybe
that problems aren&rsquo;t big enough. It is better to address problems and features
hat will bring people who are not currently your customers.</p>

<p>Another good idea by Emmett is that you shouldn&rsquo;t concentrate only on the
current market and try to attract the customers of your competitors. What you
really need to do is to try to bring people who didn&rsquo;t even try to use that kind
of products.</p>

<p>These were the most interesting ideas for me found in the video. If you have
other interesting ideas, don&rsquo;t hesitate to write a comment.</p>
