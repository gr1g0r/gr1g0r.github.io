<p>Good evening everybody! Today I am going to review the last video lecture about
starting a startup. So this is my last blog post here, but I will soon have
another blog, where I will mostly post development and coding stuff. I will keep
you informed about that!</p>

<p>So, today the lecturer is again Sam. I think we all remember him. So, as a final
lecture he is going to speak about things you need to pay attention during
starting a startup.</p>

<h2 id="management">Management</h2>

<p>At first there is no management. And it works as long as the company size is
under 25. Nevertheless, when the structure fails, it fails at once. All you need
to do is to make sure every employee knows who his manager is. You need a clear
reporting structure, without which it will be really bad.</p>

<p>According to Sam there are four mistakes that people do when they become
managers:</p>

<ul>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to be afraid of hiring senior people</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to be in &ldquo;Hero mode&rdquo; (Being example for everyone)</li>
<li>Let your employees to make decisions</li>
<li>You really need personal organization</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hr">HR</h2>

<p>According to Sam, this is one of the most ignored part in startups, but is very
important for success. That&rsquo;s is because when company gets bigger, it becomes
harder to manage your employees, and here HR can come to rescue.</p>

<p>Another advice Sam gives (which according to him other investors will not give)
is to always give a lot of equity to your employees.</p>

<h2 id="company-productivity">Company Productivity</h2>

<p>As the company grows the productivity of the company goes down, if you don&rsquo;t do
anything to keep it. The main reason for that is either employees are not in the
same page or are working against each other. If you manage to keep everyone in
same direction, then you are half the way to success!</p>

<h2 id="ip-trademarks-and-patents">IP, Trademarks and Patents</h2>

<p>You have 12 month to patent something after announcing it. Hence, 12 months
after lunch is a good time to start patenting. Another option is to file
provisional patents, which will keep your place in line and give you another
year to think whether you want t patent it or no.</p>

<h2 id="marketing-and-pr">Marketing and PR</h2>

<p>According to some you don&rsquo;t need to care about this at first. Work not towards
media marketing or PR, but work to have a working product, and when you have it
you can think about marketing.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t need PR firms, just find several journalists and develop close
relationships with them, so that they understand you and contact them yourself.</p>

<p>This is where my review ends, see you soon!</p>
