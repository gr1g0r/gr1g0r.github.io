<p>Hello everyone! Today I am going to write about all the useful things I learned
from this video lecture. Today the speaker is Kevin Hale, who appears to be the
CEO of Spectacle.</p>

<p>Well, according to him, if you want to make billion dollars, you need to keep
working on the values that helped you make your first dollar.</p>

<p>You need to act with new users like you are trying to date them, and with
existing users like you are trying to get married with them.</p>

<p>So, for new users, like in dating, first impression is very important. You need
to give first time users experience which will make them to keep using your
product. But how to do that?</p>

<p>Well, you need to use everything in you arsenal to create such moments for your
users, which they will not forget and keep coming back for more. The first email
you send, the first page they see after the first successful login, the first
customer support, all are example of means by which you can make the first
impressions about your product memorable.</p>

<p>Then Kevin brings examples of how to add personality to your products. Well, of
course his examples are very good, but let me tell something from my own
experience on this one :)</p>

<p>In my company, me and my friend were working on an Android app. And since the
app was in pre-alfa build, it crashed a lot. So we decided that it needs a crash
page, where it said sorry and gave an option to relaunch the application. On the
first version of the crash page, we added a picture of a dead bug. It was cool and funny, but later, we
decided that it may be not professional and replaced it with the logo of the
app. Now, after this lecture, I am feeling like to go back and change it to the
bug image :)</p>

<p>By the way, here is the image!

<h2 id="support-driven-development">Support driven development</h2>

<p>According to Kevin before lunching the product, we, the developers, think that
our code is 100% genius. However, after the lunch of the application it turns
out that there a lot of fixes to be done, customer support and many other stuff.
With Support driven development we can inject values like responsibility,
accountability and humanity into software development process.</p>

<p>SDD is super simple:
<strong>Make everyone to do customer support.</strong></p>

<p>But how will this help to inject the values, you will ask.
Well, imagine you are a software developer and you get a call about the same bug
several times. What will you do? Right, you will stop everything you are doing
and stop that bug.</p>

<p>There are many many more important points in the video, but these were the most
useful ones according to me. If there are other points you find interesting,
just let me know in the comment section!</p>
