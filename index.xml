      <description>Hello everyone, Today I am going to review another video about how to start a startup. Today the guest lecturer is Ben Horowitz and he is going to speak about how to manage.
Because of lack of time, he speaks only about one of the concepts of management, since according to him, that is where the majority of CEOs screw up.
According to Ben, when making a critical decision, you have to understand how it&amp;rsquo;s going to be interpreted from every point of view.</description>

      <description>Hello everyone, Today I am going to review another video about how to start a startup. Today the guest lecturer is Aaron Levie who is going to talk about how to operate.
According to Aaron, forging a company is much harder than forging a product, since people are irrational. Building an organization is essentially similar to taking all the irrational individuals you know placing them in one building, and after that living with them twelve hours per day.</description>

 The decisions while you hire your first 10 employees are one of the mot important ones, as by hiring those 10 people, you are actually hiring 100 people.</description>

What I learned in this video lecture is:
To get people invest in your company you must show that you are a leader, you are obsessed with your idea and you need the product as well</description>

      <description>Hello everyone! Today&amp;rsquo;s video lecture&amp;rsquo;s speaker is Stanley Tang, who is the founder of DoorDash.
Well, at first Stanley was telling about how everything started in DoorDash and how they tested whether delivery system was a good idea. What they did, is pretty simple! They just launched a demo website in an hour and tested if they would get orders.
The main message Stanley tried to give was that you don&amp;rsquo;t need much to start a startup.</description>

You need to act with new users like you are trying to date them, and with existing users like you are trying to get married with them.</description>

      <description>Hey Everyone! In this post I am going to write about my takeaways from this lecture of Peter Thiel, who, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is the founder of PayPal and is going to talk about how to start a startup.
So basically what peter concentrates on is that for a successful startup you need a market where you will have monopoly.
For me, the interesting part in this video starts from the part about how to create a monopoly.</description>

      <description>Hey everyone! In this post I am going to review another lecture about starting startups. The speaker in this lecture is Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y combinator and my favorite news blog Hacker News.
Paul once more highlights the importance of choosing the right team members. According to him we must choose team members as we would choose our friends.
Another part I find important in the video is that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert in startups, you just need to work with your users in the right way.</description>

      <description>This video&amp;rsquo;s first speaker is the president of Y Combinator Sam Altman. One of the biggest investment in IT are that Y Combinator had is its Hacker News website. As a daily user of the Hacker News it became more interesting for me what this guy will talk about.
Well, I have to say that the talk was quite interesting and informative. He mainly talked about the four areas that you have to excel at to be able to start a successful startup.</description>
